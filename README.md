# Online Food Ordering System
The goal of this project is to design and implement a full-stack Online Food Ordering System using Python (Flask), HTML/CSS, and MySQL. The platform facilitates digital food ordering for customers and management capabilities for restaurant managers. It enables customers to browse restaurants, place orders, and rate their experiences, while restaurant managers can manage menus, track orders, and view sales statistics. This report documents the implementation of Part 2, focusing on the Flask-based web application, database integration, and fulfillment of functional requirements. This system bridges the gap between traditional dine-in and digital convenience, providing an intuitive web-based interface for both end-users.
